## Problem to solve
You should create a simple web application that shows metadata for episodes and podcasts. The data that should be used is located at (`assets\data`). The app should cointain the following:
1. [x] Two lists, one with podcasts and one with episodes. (Note: substituted by one expandable list)
2. [x] A landing page for a podcast (Note: substituted by one expandable list)
3. [x] A landing page for an episode

- [x] The landing pages should be shown when the user clicks on a list item.

## Submission
Zip the repository containing your solution and submit it via email to the recruiter that contacted you.

### Metadata 
#### List items
A podcast item needs to have:
- [x] Title
- [x] A part of the desciption (Note: substituted by full length description)
- [x] The number of episodes

An episode item needs to have:
- [x] Title
- [x] A part of the desciption (Note: full description shown in the episode landing page)
- [x] The length of the episode
- [x] The date when the episode was created

#### Podcast landing page
It needs to have:
- [x] Title
- [x] The full description

#### Episode landing page
It needs to have:
- [x] Title
- [x] The name of the podcast
- [x] The full description
- [x] The length of the episode
- [x] The date when the episode was created

## Design 
You are free to design the app in the way you want.

## Data location
The data is located in:
`assets\data`
It cointains two lists. One with podcasts (6 items) and one with episodes (4 items). 

*Remark* - Episode `duration` is in seconds.

## Requirements
- [x] If nothing else is specified you're free to solve the problem in `Vue`, `React` or `Angular`
- [x] It needs to look great in both phones and desktop
- [x] The lists must support a lot of items.
- [x] Do not make the task harder than it is. It should be solved in a couple of hours.
- [x] Document how to run your application and anything else that you feel is important.

## Optional
- [x] If you'd like you can set up a backend (e.g. node or java) where you are storing and requesting the data.
- [ ] Write tests (Note: could not add jest unit tests due to time constrains)
